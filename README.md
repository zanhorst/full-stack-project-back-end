# =====Development Story=====

The API for this project was actually pretty quick and simple. Using auth as a reference i was able to get most of my calls working the first time i wrote them. I never really ran into any bugs with the backend. I did play around with it and fix some syntax errors and mislabeled things, but for the most part, I didn't have any issues with this side of the project. It just took a while because of my computer being broken. :(

# =====Unsolved Issues=====

THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE APPLICATION!!

This is only the MVP of the application for V1. It does not include v2 relationships or schemas. Those will come before I continue work on the client side of this application.

v2 will include: individual items and prices (relationsips, new schema) to be included when you a show or index your list(s).
